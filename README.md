# Ball-Blitz
Ball Blitz is a fast-paced 3D dodgeball game built with Unity and Blender, where the player controls a single Thrower and competes against three AI Dodgers. The goal is to eliminate all opponents within 2 minutes using precise aiming, timing, and wall ricochets in a physics-based arena.
